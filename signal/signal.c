/*
 * signal.c

 * signal associates the function pointed to by func with the signal sig. When
 * a signal occurs, the value of func determines the action taken as follows:
 * if func is SIG_DFL, the default handling for that signal will occur; if func
 * is SIG_IGN, the signal will be ignored; otherwise, the default handling for
 * the signal is restored (SIG_DFL), and the function func is called with sig
 * as its argument. Returns the value of func for the previous call to signal
 * for the signal sig, or SIG_ERR if the request fails.
