FUNCTION
<<fmax>>, <<fmaxf>>--maximum
INDEX
	fmax
INDEX
	fmaxf

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <math.h>
	double fmax(double <[x]>, double <[y]>);
	float fmaxf(float <[x]>, float <[y]>);

DESCRIPTION
The <<fmax>> functions determine the maximum numeric value of their arguments.
NaN arguments are treated as missing data:  if one argument is a NaN and the
other numeric, then the <<fmax>> functions choose the numeric value.

RETURNS
The <<fmax>> functions return the maximum numeric value of their arguments.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C, POSIX.
