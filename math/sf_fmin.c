FUNCTION
<<fmin>>, <<fminf>>--minimum
INDEX
	fmin
INDEX
	fminf

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <math.h>
	double fmin(double <[x]>, double <[y]>);
	float fminf(float <[x]>, float <[y]>);

DESCRIPTION
The <<fmin>> functions determine the minimum numeric value of their arguments.
NaN arguments are treated as missing data:  if one argument is a NaN and the
other numeric, then the <<fmin>> functions choose the numeric value.

RETURNS
The <<fmin>> functions return the minimum numeric value of their arguments.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C, POSIX.
