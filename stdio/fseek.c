FUNCTION
<<fseek>>, <<fseeko>>---set file position

INDEX
	fseek
INDEX
	fseeko

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fseek(FILE *<[fp]>, long <[offset]>, int <[whence]>)
	int fseeko(FILE *<[fp]>, off_t <[offset]>, int <[whence]>)

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fseek(<[fp]>, <[offset]>, <[whence]>)
	FILE *<[fp]>;
	long <[offset]>;
	int <[whence]>;

	int fseeko(<[fp]>, <[offset]>, <[whence]>)
	FILE *<[fp]>;
	off_t <[offset]>;
	int <[whence]>;


DESCRIPTION
Objects of type <<FILE>> can have a ``position'' that records how much
of the file your program has already read.  Many of the <<stdio>> functions
depend on this position, and many change it as a side effect.

You can use <<fseek>>/<<fseeko>> to set the position for the file identified by
<[fp]>.  The value of <[offset]> determines the new position, in one
of three ways selected by the value of <[whence]> (defined as macros
in `<<stdio.h>>'):

<<SEEK_SET>>---<[offset]> is the absolute file position (an offset
from the beginning of the file) desired.  <[offset]> must be positive.

<<SEEK_CUR>>---<[offset]> is relative to the current file position.
<[offset]> can meaningfully be either positive or negative.

<<SEEK_END>>---<[offset]> is relative to the current end of file.
<[offset]> can meaningfully be either positive (to increase the size
of the file) or negative.

See <<ftell>>/<<ftello>> to determine the current file position.

RETURNS
<<fseek>>/<<fseeko>> return <<0>> when successful.  On failure, the
result is <<EOF>>.  The reason for failure is indicated in <<errno>>:
either <<ESPIPE>> (the stream identified by <[fp]> doesn't support
repositioning) or <<EINVAL>> (invalid file position).

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fseek>>.

<<fseeko>> is defined by the Single Unix specification.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<close>>, <<fstat>>, <<isatty>>,
<<lseek>>, <<read>>, <<sbrk>>, <<write>>.
