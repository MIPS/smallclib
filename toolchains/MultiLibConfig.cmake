# MultiLibConfig
# --------------
#
# This module provides generic stubs for building libraries with a C
# compiler that supports multi-lib configurations with the
# command-line option '-print-multi-lib'. Output format is expected to
# match that of . For compilers that do not support this option,
# MultiLibConfig has no effect and the default configuration of the
# library is built.
#
# Fine grained control of multilib configurations is provided with the
# variables MULTILIB_SELECT, MULTILIB_SKIP and MULTILIB_BUILDLIST
#
# MULTILIB_SELECT=[ALL|<regex>]
# ALL: all configurations, except those skipped by MULTILIB_SKIP are
# 	built
# <regex>: only configs matching the pattern, excluding those skipped by
# 	MULTILIB_SKIP are built
# If MULTILIB_SELECT is not specified, only the default configuration
# is built.
#
# MULTILIB_SKIP=[NONE|<regex>]
# NONE: all configurations selected by MULTILIB_SELECT are built
# regex: only those configurations selected by MULTILIB_SELECT, which
# 	do NOT match the pattern are built
# If MULTILIB_SKIP is not specified, behaviour is same as
# MULTILIB_SKIP=NONE. If MULTILIB_SELECT is not specified, MULTILIB_SKIP
# is ignored.
#
# MULTILIB_BUILDLIST=<filename>
# <filename>: Only those multilib directories listed in the file will
#             be built.
#
# This module defines the following variables:
# 
# .. variable:: MULTILIB_PRE_TOP
# Flag to indicate top-level of multilib recursion, before creating
# actual multilib targets.
#
# .. variable:: MULTILIB_TOP
# Flag to indicate top-level of multilib recursion, after creating
# multilib targets.
#
# .. variable:: MULTILIB_FLAVOUR
# `Compiler options' part of a multilib descriptor, only visible in
# the recursive sub-context.
# 
# .. variable:: MULTILIB_DIR
# `Target directory' part of multilib descriptor, only visible in the
# recursive sub-context.
#
# .. variable:: MULTILIB_NAME
# Same as MULTILIB_FLAVOUR, or 'default' for the default multilib
# configuration, where MULTILIB_FLAVOUR is empty. Only visible in the
# recursive sub-context.
#
# .. variable:: MULTILIB_TARGET_<name>
# For each library added, a reference to the current multilib target.
# 
# Example Usage:
# .. code-block::
#   set(sources_math sin.c cos.s floor.c ...)
#
#   include(MultiLibConfig)
#
#   multilib_build_setup()
#
#   if (MULTILIB_TOP)
#     <Do everything you want to do only once, like installing headers,
#     top-level checks, etcetra>
#   else (MULTILIB_TOP)
#     ## build the library for each multilib configuration>
#     ## This step creates the target and sets up compiler flags for it based 
#     ## on the multilib configuration. It also creates a handle for the user 
#     ## to override target properties later.
#     multilib_add_library(m STATIC ${sources_math})
#     ## The handle MULTILIB_TARGET_<name> allows user to override target
#     ## properties or set install path
#     set_target_properties(${MULTILIB_TARGET_m} PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME mymath)
#     install(TARGETS ${MULTILIB_TARGET_m}
# 	 ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/${MULTILIB_DIR})
